# Spring-Boot-Microservices
This repo contains basic configurational  code for building spring microservices apps. 


#The Code Base contains multiple spring boot apps which offer its services in following way:
1.config-server -> This app store all configuration files for all services
2.eureka-server-> This app helps to store location of deployed service instance
3.gateway-service -> This app helps in routing the call to all services through one door.
4.auth-server-> This app helps to authenticate and authorize the users making the call.
 and rest of the apps are just there to play with these configuration or you can say our solution to problem.
